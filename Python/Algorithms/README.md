What Are Algorithms in Programming?

An algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions for solving a problem or performing a task.
In programming, algorithms are written using programming languages so that computers can execute them.

Think of an algorithm as a recipe:
	•	Ingredients = Input data
	•	Steps in the recipe = Algorithm instructions
	•	Finished dish = Output/result
